# Elizas-Numbers
An android app in which a player guesses a mystery number between 1 and 1000 (configurable). A player has 12 (configurable) guesses to determine the mystery number, and a player's best number of guesses throughout all played games is saved within the app. A player is brought to a won or lost screen, depending on if they can guess the mystery number before their guesses run out.  All guesses for a game are listed on the main guessing screen.

Not available in the app store, but can be transfered to an Android device when run on it through an IDE.

A web version of the app is in progress.
